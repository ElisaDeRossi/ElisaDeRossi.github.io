### Repo for [elisaderossi.github.io](https://elisaderossi.github.io)

This is a very simple website I put together to showcase some things I can do.

The technology I used is very simple as the website uses HTML5, SCSS and TypeScript, with no particular frameworks or libraries except for HTMX, which is only featured to prove that I know it exists.
If you know the basis, it is easier to build on them.
