### Repo for <elisaderossi.github.io>

This is a very simple website I put together to showcase some things I can do.

I am not a designer and I cannot put on the internet a copy of some popular website either, so the UI sucks.

The technology I used is very simple as the website uses HTML5, SCSS and TypeScript, with no particular frameworks except for HTMX, which is only featured to prove that I know it exists.
If you know the basis, it is easier to build on them.
